global fradar g

%% System constants
g       = 9.81;                     % Gravity acceleration (m/s2)
lbragg  = 299.8/2/fradar;           % Bragg wavelength (m)
fbragg  = sqrt(g*2*pi/lbragg)/2/pi; % Bragg frequency (Hz)
df      = freq(2)-freq(1);          % Frequency bin resolution of Doppler spectrum
k0      = 2*pi/(2*lbragg);          % Radar wavenumber (rads/m)

%% Parameters defining details of analysis to be used
%
dom = 1;            % use only the side with the largest Bragg peak (for wind and Allatabi swell)
                    % when the difference between the two peaks is <3dB then use both sides.
peak_diff_db= 3;    % for use with dom = 1, the max peak difference to use both peaks
gaus_fit    = 1;    % fit gaussian for Bragg integral halfwidth
maxv        = 2;    % Max velocity (in m/s) defining the search region for Bragg peaks
np          = 5;    % number of points on each side of Bragg peak used for Bragg peak estimation
maxdf = maxv/lbragg;% Maximum Doppler shift expected (used to search for Bragg peaks, given maxv)

%% Parameters defining where to look for swell and second order spectra
%
Highf   = 0.5;      % Maximum wave freq (Hz); defines the second order upper limit
Lowf    = 0.025;    % Minimum wave freq (Hz); it defines the limit between 1st and 2nd order Doppler spectra
minf    = 0.02;     % Min halfwidth of Bragg Peak
minfs   = 0.05;     % Lowest swell peak frequency allowed (Hz)
