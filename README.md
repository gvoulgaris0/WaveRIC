# WaveRIC
Wave Radar Inversion Code (WaveRIC) as described in Alattabi, Cahl and Voulgaris 2019, JATECH

This is the code described in Alattabi et al. (2019) for the inversion of the 2nd-order of a Doppler spectrum from an HF/VHF radar system. This is a hybrid, empirical radar wave inversion technique that treats swell and wind waves separately. Prior to the inversion, the 2nd order spectrum is normalized using Barrick’s (1977b) weighting function as this removes harmonic and corner reflection peaks from the inversion and improves the results. 

Alattabi et al. (2019) presented calibrations coefficiens for the wind and swell parts of the Doppler spectrum. However, not clear if these coefficients are universal as this is under verification at this time.
