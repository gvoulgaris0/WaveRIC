# WaveRIC: Wave Radar Inversion Code 
(see Alattabi, Cahl and Voulgaris (2019), JTECH)  

This is the code described in Alattabi et al. (2019) for the inversion of the 2nd-order of a Doppler spectrum from an HF/VHF radar system. This is a hybrid, empirical radar wave inversion technique that treats swell and wind waves separately. Prior to the inversion, the 2nd order spectrum is normalized using Barrick’s (1977b) weighting function as this removes harmonic and corner reflection peaks from the inversion and improves the results. 

Alattabi et al. (2019) presented calibrations coefficiens for the wind and swell parts of the Doppler spectrum. However, not clear if these coefficients are universal as this is under verification at this time.

The files are located in three directories  
- WaveRIC  
-It contains the main functions used to run the inversion (ConfigRWIC.m, masterRadarWIC.m, RadarWIC.m);  
-file RWIC_Contents.html contains inflormation about the functions included in the package;  
-master_testing.m is an example using the functions to recreate the spectra in the paper, figure 10;;
- WaveRIC/lib  
It contains a number of functions called by the main function
- WaveRIC/html and WaveRIC/lib/html  
It contains explanations for each function in html files. These are called from RWIC_Contents.html  
- WaveRIC/data  
It contains the data files used by master_testing.m for running examples from the Alattabi et al (2019) paper; Events A to H. It recreates Figure 11 in the paper.
