%% PXYsideband.m
%  Converts F_Doppler to wave F and analyzes 2nd order continuum
%%
function [fw,E,Ew,f] = PXYsideband(freq,PXY,f_low,f_high,fpn,Wi,switc1)
%% [fw,E,Ew,f] = PXYsideband(freq,PXY,f_low,f_high,fpn,Wi,switc1)
%
%  This function calculates the wave frequencies (fw) from the second order
%  sidebands. It also returns the energy (E) and the weighted energy (Ew) of
%  the second order sidebands. The Doppler frequencies of the sideband are
%  given by f. This function looks for the first local minimum away from the
%  Bragg peak, starting at f_low Doppler frequency. It returns the sidebands higher than this
%  local minimum, but lower than f_high Doppler frequency.
%
%% Input
%  fbragg - Theoretical Bragg frequency of radar (Hz)
%  freq   - Doppler frequency in Hz of radar spectra
%  PXY    - Doppler spectra in linear units
%  f_low  - only process sideband at or above this frequency
%  f_high - only process sideband at or below this frequency
%  fpn    - location of Bragg peak corresponding to this sideband
%  Wi     - sideband number 1-4 from lowest to highest frequency
%  switc1 - [optional, default =1] if =999, keeps all 2nd order data 
%             above f_low and below fwmin (see code). For testing
%             purposes.
%
%% Output
%  fw    - wave frequencies corresponding to this sideband (in Hz) 
%  E     - Doppler energy of this sideband
%  Ew    - E, weighted by Barrick's weighting function
%  f     - Doppler frequencies corresponding to this sideband (in Hz)
