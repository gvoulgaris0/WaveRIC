%% hfr_noise.m
%  Function to estimate the noise level from a spectrum
%%
function  [Noise,fp,fn] = hfr_noise(freq,PXY,fbragg,maxdf)
%% [Noise,fp,fn] = hfr_noise(freq,PXY,fbragg,maxdf,np)
%
% This function calculates the noise level (Noise) in dB of an HF radar
% spectra (PXY) with the energy in dB units. The approximate positions of
% the positive (fp) and negative (fn) Bragg peaks are also estimated. 
%
%% Input
%
%    freq   - Doppler frequency of radar spectra (in Hz)
%    PXY    - Doppler spectral energy (in dB)
%    fbragg - Bragg frequency of radar system (in Hz)
%    maxdf  - Maximum expected doppler shift of Bragg peak (in Hz) from theoretical positions
%
%% Output
%    Noise  - Noise level calculated from the outer edge of the side with
%             the smaller Bragg peak (in dB)
%    fp     - approximate location of positive Bragg peak (in Hz)
%    fn     - approximate location of negative Bragg peak (in Hz)
