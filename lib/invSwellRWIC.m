%% Input
%    freq        - Array of Doppler Spectral frequency in Hz
%    fradar      - Radar operating frequency (in MHz)
%    PXY(1:freq) - Array of Spectral Energy (in dB), do not send arrays of NaN
%    fc          - Don't find swell peaks above this frequency (Hz), usually the same as fc

%
%% Output
%    fswell      - Swell frequency (Hz)
%    Eswell      - Normalized by 1st order peak Doppler energy (at swell range)(Hz^-1)

%% Internal function: swell_peak.m

function [fp,Ep,Sp,i]=swell_peak(freq,PXY,f_low,f_high)
%% [fp,Ep,Sp,i]=swell_peak(freq,PXY,f_low,f_high)
%
% Function to find the location of the swell peak (fp) using a 4th order
% SNR weighting. It looks for swell peaks in PXY within the range f_low - f_high. 
% The largest peak that is a a weighted peak is identified. The integral of
% the swell peak over 5 points (2 points either side of the max) and the 
% energy at the swell peak  frequency (Ep) is calculated.
%
%% Input
% freq      - Doppler frequency in Hz of radar spectra
% PXY       - Doppler spectra in linear units
% f_low     - low freq. for swell region (f_low < swell <= f_high)
% f_high    - high freq. for swell region
%
%% Output
% fp        - Swell peak frequency (in Hz) SNR^4 weighting with two points on each side of swell peak
% Ep        - Max Doppler enegy at swell frequency peak
% Sp        - Integrated Doppler energy over 5 points centered at the swell peak
% i         - Indices of the integration for E_wang
