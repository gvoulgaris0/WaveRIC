%
% This function calculates the second order sideband ratio (R) and weighted
% ratio (Rw) for wave frequencies (fw). It is based on Barricks/Heron
% approach and it is used for wind waves.
%
%% Input
%  freq:        Array of Doppler frequencies for the Doppler spectrum (in Hz)
%  PXY(1:freq): Array of Spectral Energy (in dB), do not send arrays of NaN
%  swplot:      >0 if you want a plot [optional, default no plot]
%
%% Output
%  fw:       Ocean wave frequencies (in Hz)
%  R:        normalized (no weighted) 2nd order sideband (no units) 
%  Rw:       weighted (by Barrick's weighting function)and normalized 2nd order sideband (no units) 
%  D:        Ratio of normalized 2nd order sidebands around a peak [(R_right_of_peak)/(R_left_of_peak)] (no units) 
%  Dw:       Ratio of normalized & weighted 2nd order sideband around a peak [(Rw_right_of_peak)/(Rw_left_of_peak)](no units) 
%  debug:    Extra structure variable used for debugging purposes, for each sideband.
%
%% Debugging parameters
%  debug.fw1-n   the ocean wave frequency from the Doppler spectra for sideband n
%  debug.E1-n    Doppler energy for sideband n
%  debug.R1-n    normalized (by 1st order) 2nd order sideband for sideband n
%  debug.Rw1-n   normalized and weighted 2nd order sideband for sideband n
%                where n=1,2,3,or 4 indicating specific sideband as follows:
%                 1 negative Doppler frequencies, left of the adjacent Bragg peak
%                 2 negative Doppler frequencies, right of the adjacent Bragg peak 
%                 3 positive Doppler frequencies, left of the adjacent Bragg peak
%                 4 positive Doppler frequencies, right of the adjacent Bragg peak
%  debug.SNR1    signal to noise ratio for 1st order
%  debug.SNR2    signal to noise ratio for 2nd order
%  debug.sigma1  width of Bragg peak
%  debug.Noise   Noise level
%  debug.S11     ratio of std of Bargg peak region (to get wind direction/local wind wave direction)
